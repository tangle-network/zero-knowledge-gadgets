//! A Plonk gadget to check membership within a set.
//!
//! To check whether an element `x` is in a set `A`, the gadget takes the
//! difference between `x` and every element of `A`, takes the product of
//! all those differences, and checks if it is equal to zero.  The product
//! is zero if and only if `x` is in `A`; however, the individual
//! elements of `A` are not revealed, making it zero-knowledge.
//!
//! For example, one could check if a certain Merkle root hash is a member
//! of a set of Merkle root hashes.
